Here are the changes we've made since the submission:

- Removed some print lines, having too many bugged our robot.
- Changed objectDistance to cm, it was the same variable but with different names. Removed the inches calculation.
- Reduced motor speed to adjust for the downstairs floor type.
- Changed object detection threshold to 1800 to adjust for weird sensor readings.
