## Path Planning Arduino

Team: Hritika, Lelia, and Amelie 

### 1. Introduction : What we want to do  
We are trying to determine how our robot can navigate through a space with known or unknown obstacles. It will be an obstacle avoiding robot with the capability of detecting objects in its course and navigating around those objects by making a proper decision.
### 2. How we will solve this problem   
We’ll be using map representation. Once our space will be represented as a graph, we’ll use one of the shortest-path graph algorithms.
### 3. Expected List of Features
The anticipated program provided in the architecture of the robot is as follows,
Ability to detect objects in its path by predetermined distance ranges.
Look for a new path comparatively to an open direction.
Indicate object detection and control its speed.
### 4. List of equipment needed (if we need to buy)
Arduino Leonardo
Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
